					<p> Welcome to my Website! My name is Daniel, and I'm an Engineer. Actually, I started out college as an Exercise Science major
						of all things. At the time, I was working as a CrossFit coach, which was a cool first job I guess. But since I didn't really know what I
						wanted to do, I thought maybe fitness be a good place to start. But that was super boring, so I figured I'd move back up to
						Seattle and try out some sort of Engineering next. I didn't like zappy electric things, and Computer Science was for the smart kids, so I
						ended up in Mechanical Engineering. I transferred in, so all my credits and schedule got messed up pretty good, which meant I needed
						to take 1 extra class my final quarter of my senior year to keep my financial aid. I took Java Programming. Unfortunately I really liked it,
						so I've spent the last couple years learning how to code, so maybe I can do it professionally one day... :)
					</p>
