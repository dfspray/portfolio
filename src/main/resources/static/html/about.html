					<p> Hi! My name is Daniel, and I'm an Engineer. Actually, I started out college as an Exercise Science major
						of all things. At the time, I was working as a CrossFit coach, which was a cool first job I guess. But since I didn't really know what I
						wanted to do, I thought maybe fitness be a good place to start. But that was super boring, so I figured I'd move back up to
						Seattle and try out some sort of Engineering next. In my mind, electricity is basically magic, and I thought Computer Science was for the smart kids, so I
						ended up in Mechanical Engineering. I transferred in, so all my credits and schedule got messed up pretty good, which meant I needed
						to take 1 extra class my final quarter of my senior year to keep my financial aid. I took Java Programming. Unfortunately I really liked it,
						so I've spent the last couple years learning how to code, so maybe I can do it professionally one day... :)

					<p> Ahhhhh, I feel like such a has-been taking about my fitness career, but here goes... I'll start by saying: I can't do what I used to! I worked for 9 years as a coach
						at CrossFit Bellevue, CrossFit Peak Performance, and Lake Hills CrossFit. During that time, I was a 2 time NorthWest Regional competitor, reaching 14th overall in
						Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska. I could clean and jerk over 300 pounds, and snatch 245. But don't get me wrong, I'm not very big... I'm only 5'5" and
						weigh 170 pounds. What I liked most about fitness was not the work, or the adrenaline, or the way I looked. It was the biomechanics. Being able to take advantage of
						physics to beat bigger, stronger guys by being more efficient gave me some silly sense of satisfaction. It's probably why I ended up liking Engineering a lot more
						than Exercise Science.

					<p> I'm an odd combination of athlete and nerd. On one hand I've trained future Navy Seals, and on the other, I play Pokemon and Minecraft like a 12 year old...
						I also enjoy Overwatch, and have a few solo wins in Fortnite. I'm not gonna pretend I'm any good at these games, since the rankings tell me I'm pretty much average. But I have fun, which is
						the important part. I put together my own PC in 2018, and run a Ryzen 7 2700x with NVidia GTX970 SLI. I'll update eventually, but for now I can max out my 144hz monitor,
						and I'm not good enough at anything to blame my computer anyways. (And yes, I absolutely mounted my 32" screen with a monitor arm to swing over my bed for movie nights!)
