					<h1 class="pageTitle">About</h1>
					<p> Hi! My name is Daniel, and I'm an Engineer. I actually started out college as an Exercise Science major
						of all things. At the time, I was working as a CrossFit coach, which was a cool first job. But since I didn't really know what I
						wanted to do with my career, I thought maybe fitness be a good place to start. After a few classes, however, I realized that really wasn't a good fit for me.
						So I moved back up to Seattle and try out Mechanical Engineering next. Being a transfer student, my credits and schedule weren't perfectly aligned,
						which meant I needed to take 1 extra class my final quarter of my senior year to keep my financial aid. This led me to take Java Programming on a whim,
						and I ended up really liking it. So, thus far in my career I have continued to pursue projects in both software and mechanical engineering whenever I've
						gotten the opportunity.

					<p> Ahhhhh, I feel like such a has-been taking about my fitness career, but here goes... I'll start by saying: I can't do what I used to! I worked for 9 years as a coach
						at CrossFit Bellevue, CrossFit Peak Performance, and Lake Hills CrossFit. During that time, I was a 2 time NorthWest Regional competitor, reaching 14th overall in
						Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska. I could clean and jerk over 300 pounds, and snatch 245. But don't get me wrong, I'm not very big... I'm only 5'5" and
						weigh 170 pounds. What I liked most about fitness was not the work, or the adrenaline, or the way I looked. It was the biomechanics. Being able to take advantage of
						physics to beat bigger, stronger guys by being more efficient gave me some silly sense of satisfaction. It's probably why I ended up liking Engineering a lot more
						than Exercise Science.

					<p> My hobbies list is all over the place! I have enjoyed anything from Olympic Weightlifting to building computers. Right now, I'm having fun playing a lot of
						golf. Unofficially, I have a single digit handicap, and I play JPX921 tour irons, Kirkland Signature wedges and putter, 3 and 4 Taylormade Burner Superfast 2.0
						hybrids, and a ST200 3 wood and driver. At the moment, I'm looking forward to setting up my own indoor golf simulator at home!
					</p><p>
						I also tinker with my computer setup constantly. This past year, I've added a 3D printer, and will be doing more portfolio projects with it. I've started uploading
						videos to my projects page, so check that out if you haven't already!
