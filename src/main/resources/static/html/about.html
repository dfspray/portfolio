					<h1 class="pageTitle">About</h1>
					<p> Hi! My name is Daniel, and I'm an Engineer. Actually, I started out college as an Exercise Science major
						of all things. At the time, I was working as a CrossFit coach, which was a cool first job I guess. But since I didn't really know what I
						wanted to do, I thought maybe fitness be a good place to start. That really wasn't a good fit for me, so I figured I'd move back up to
						Seattle and try out some sort of Engineering next. I didn't like Electrical, and I didn't fully understand what Computer Science was
						at the time, so I ended up in Mechanical Engineering. I transferred in, so all my credits and schedule got messed up pretty good, which meant I needed
						to take 1 extra class my final quarter of my senior year to keep my financial aid. I took Java Programming. I ended up really liking it,
						so I've spent the last couple years learning how to code so maybe I can do it professionally one day... :)

					<p> Ahhhhh, I feel like such a has-been taking about my fitness career, but here goes... I'll start by saying: I can't do what I used to! I worked for 9 years as a coach
						at CrossFit Bellevue, CrossFit Peak Performance, and Lake Hills CrossFit. During that time, I was a 2 time NorthWest Regional competitor, reaching 14th overall in
						Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska. I could clean and jerk over 300 pounds, and snatch 245. But don't get me wrong, I'm not very big... I'm only 5'5" and
						weigh 170 pounds. What I liked most about fitness was not the work, or the adrenaline, or the way I looked. It was the biomechanics. Being able to take advantage of
						physics to beat bigger, stronger guys by being more efficient gave me some silly sense of satisfaction. It's probably why I ended up liking Engineering a lot more
						than Exercise Science.

					<p> My hobbies list is all over the place! I have enjoyed anything from Olympic Weightlifting to building computers. Right now, I'm having fun playing a lot of
						golf. My current set of clubs is getting older, so I'm trying to get my handicap down to single digits to feel like I've earned a new set.
					</p><p>
						I also tinker with my computer setup constantly. This year, I've added a 3D printer, and will be doing more portfolio projects with it. I've started uploading
						videos to my projects page, so check that out if you haven't already!
